      <br>
      <p>This website was made for the Brook Codes 2023 Hackathon, with the goal to spread hope and help solve the mental health issues that plauge so many teens in MCPS. With our quick chat function, we allow students to anonymously contact lisenced school counselors through an online chat, provide resources for anyone struggling with mental health issues (or for people who know those struggling with mental health issues), and also allow students to find school counselors near them to talk. We want to help those who need it, and let them know that no matter what, they are not alone and there are people who can help.</p>
